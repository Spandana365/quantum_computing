This project is about gene sequence alignment using quantum computing.
The classical approach for gene sequence alignment is  Needleman-Wunsch Alignment which is based on deterministic approach, is relatively slower.
So to overcome the speed and accuracy here is the quantum based approach which works on probabilistic way and is accurate and speed. 
In the output it asks users to upload the datasets of the dna of various organisms and provides the percentage of similarity and dissimilarity between the organisms. With this we can get to know the hierarchical relationship between the organisms.
